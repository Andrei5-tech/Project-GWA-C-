## 📘 GWA Calculator in C++

This repository contains a **C++ console-based General Weighted Average (GWA) calculator** that computes a student’s final grade based on **Prelim, Midterm, Prefinal, and Final** examination scores.

### ✨ Features

* Computes GWA using fixed academic weight distribution:

  * Prelim: 20%
  * Midterm: 20%
  * Prefinal: 20%
  * Final: 40%
* Validates user input (accepts only values between **50–100**)
* Displays GWA with **two decimal precision**
* Determines equivalent **letter grade (A+ to F)**
* Allows repeated computation using a **do–while loop**
* Beginner-friendly and well-structured C++ code

### 🛠 Technologies Used

* **C++**
* Standard libraries: `<iostream>`, `<iomanip>`

### 🎯 Purpose

This project is designed for **students and beginners** learning:

* Conditional statements (`if–else`)
* Loops (`do–while`)
* Input validation
* Basic program flow and logic in C++

### ▶ How to Run

1. Compile using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ gwa.cpp -o gwa`)
2. Run the program (`./gwa`)
3. Follow on-screen prompts to enter grades
